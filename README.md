This was a small concept project that I worked on for a week or two, just to prove the concept and help practive my node.js and other skills. It's nothing super impressive, but something fun I wanted to try and create. It is not polished or what I would consider to be in a "finished" state, but the fundamentals work and that was my goal to begin with.
